title: Fresh look on blogging

This is my first blog post using github pages.  :fireworks: :clap: :clap: :clap: :poop:

To give some background, my previous blogposts have been hosted on Google's blogger [here](http://mortonjt.blogspot.com/).
However, Blogger is incredibly sluggish when it came down to creating code blocks, math, or basically anything other than text.
At least, this is what I keep telling myself to find an excuse why I haven't written a blog post for the last year.

Since I have spent a non-trival amount of time getting this setup, I might as well explain how I got this setup.
Turns out that Github pages is becoming a really slick interface, with an interface to Jekyll, it is now pretty easy to setup templates.
The templates that I used come from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), which automates much of the process of setting up the proper tools.  You could do everything from github repo if you really wanted to.

Expect more material to come!
